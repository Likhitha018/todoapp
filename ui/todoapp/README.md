# Getting Started with Create React App
for running application locally we need visual studio code latest version and node js version 18.18.2 to download visit google an type node js click on respective download option for operating system, 
npm version 10.2.1-to install lastest version use command npm install -g npm@latest
# running backend 
use command : node index.js
# running frontend 
use command cd filename for directing  to the respective folder and then 
npm start 
if above does not work 
# for backend install express ,mongodb,multer following are the commands
npm init -y
npm install express --save
npm install cors
npm install mondodb@4.1.0 --save
npm install multer //read the request from data
# frotend 
npx install -p npm@latest
# for database use mongodb cloud IN GOOGLE
if create database name: todoappdb
collection:todoappcollection
For CONNECTION_STRING url click on connect after creating db goto drivers->copy the url or
replace with existing url your username and password in index.js file in CONNECTION_STRING
for backend:https://localhost:5000/api/todoapp/GetTasks
for frontend:https://localhost:3000
when click add task on frontend it will displayed in below list and added to db as wells as displayed on https://localhost:5000/api/todoapp/GetTask json format

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
